# Anagrab

Anagrab is an exoress.js app with a lightweight backend for playing an anagram-based game. The backend exists to enable communication between the front end JavaScript script (which handles most of the gameplay logic) and the node.js module check-word, which checks potential words against an English dictionary.

## TODO

Expand the backend to allow for posting top scores, more sophisticated choice of random words (the random number generator in JavaScript yields a lot of repeats), and allowing users to track their scores and friends' scores.
